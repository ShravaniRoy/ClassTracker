# Class Tracker

My Kuchipudi teacher is very kind and allows me to attend classes at flexible hours.
This application lets us both track our classes. 

As of now the project lets us mark the dates done by cliking on them.
I'm yet to add backend to the application.

# Enhancement

I am planning to add students module, which lets my teacher use this application to track classes
for all her students.
